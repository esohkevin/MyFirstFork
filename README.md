Intro

I am at the OpenScienceKE to learn aspects of open science which are vital to research.
These include:
1. Open Access
1. Open Source
1. Open Data etc

Why Open Science
---
This is particularly important for _research reproducibility_ and _transparency_.
It increases **dissemination of research findings** with the entire research community.

Here is one of my favorite quotes\
